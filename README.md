This service allows Medicare beneficiaries to import information in MyMedicare.gov into an application of your choice.
If you are a Medicare beneficiary you need an account on https://MyMedicare.gov.

We take security seriously.  You must choose to link the Blue Button API to 
your MyMedicare account. Once you have made the connection you can then choose 
to connect any of a growing library of personal health applications which can help 
you manage your health more easily
