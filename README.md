To use the Blue Button APi you need an account on https://MyMedicare.gov.

We take security seriously.  You must choose to link the Blue Button API to 
your MyMedicare account. Once you have made the connection you can then choose 
to connect any of a growing library of personal health applications which can help 
you manage your health more easily.

The Blue Button API is built using the latest health care standard, 
FHIR, Fast Health Care Interoperability Resources, pronounced "Fire." 
That means that new applications are being developed that can understand your data. 
This makes it easier for you to share your information with the applications, 
services or research programs you trust.
